NewUp is a command line utility that makes creating packages quick, easy and universal. NewUp attempts to make creating packages for every programming language, framework, platform, etc as painless as possible. Just because NewUp is written in PHP, does not mean generated packages have to be PHP.

## What Is This Repository?

This repository contains the core framework and utilities for the [NewUp Command Line Utility](https://github.com/newup/newup). This is where you want to be if you are interested in how NewUp works under the hood. If you simply want to install NewUp for general usage you should head on over to [https://github.com/newup/newup](https://github.com/newup/newup) where you will find installation and configuration instructions.

For example, in this repository you will find the code behind the template engine (built around [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)), the package template storage engine (utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)), the directory generator and many other components.
